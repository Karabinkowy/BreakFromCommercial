This is how i use the app:
- open YouTube app and the app in 'split screen' mode
- when an ad comes, mute sound with 'mute/unmute' button
- then open internet browser with 'launch website' button or a pdf, in your 'Donwload' folder, for you to read with 'open pdf' button 
(use 'Files' option - the one on the right - when asked for file explorer, because it doesn't start in full screen mode)
